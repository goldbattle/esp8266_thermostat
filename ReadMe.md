# ESP8266 Thermostat System

This came out of the desire to have both remote and finer grain control of our heating and cooling system.
Specifically for multi-floor houses with a single heating and cooling system it might be desirable to cool in respect to the top, ground, or basement floors.
This of course isn't achievable in a single thermostat system, and thus a multi-sensor system that reports to central controller architecture was born.
